# MixTools
MixTools is a essential plugin like [EssentialsX](essentialsx.net), [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/3742/), [SunLight](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sunlight-server-management-plugin-essentials-update-part-vi.67733/) and so on.  
But MixTools has some bugs and only a few features.(Maybe you can use other plugins directly)   
Currently, there are not many servers in use.
